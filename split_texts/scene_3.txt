Scene 3:
(Scene takes place in a grand drawing room of a historic English manor. Six suspects, a butler, a rich widow, her unfavored sister, the charming lover, a seemingly innocent nanny, and a mysterious stranger, all seated, anxiously awaiting Detective Samuel's revelation. A storm rages outside, throwing flickering shadows on their anxious faces.)

Detective Samuel, the brilliant, seasoned investigator with an uncanny knack for crime resolution, deliberately paced before them. He cleared his throat and began.

"This has been a most convoluted case," he started, "The murder of Mr. Goodwin. A man well-loved and yet, as we have found, much maligned."

He paused, letting his gaze wander over each suspect, reading their reactions. He continued, "Behind this mystery hides a tale of greed, betrayal, and secrets. Secrets that were nearly carried to the grave."

They watched him wide-eyed, breath abated. The silence was heavy against the steady drumming of the rain outside. Samuel turned to the rich widow first.

"Mrs. Goodwin, your grief is undoubtedly real. But your willingness to inherit your husband's fortune isn't entirely innocent, is it? You bitterly resent your husband's intention of leaving his fortune to his estranged sister, Miss Howard."

Mrs. Goodwin’s eyes widened in alarm, then narrowed suspiciously. But Detective Samuel had already shifted focus. “Mr. Fenton, the ‘charming lover’ as you call yourself, you are Mrs. Goodwin’s confederate, driven by desire for wealth, as you, too, find yourself on the brink of bankruptcy.”

He turned to the seemingly innocent nanny, Miss Grace, "Your romantic involvement with Mr. Goodwin created a conflict of interest, and a compelling motive for murder."

By now, their nervous glances belied their discomfort. Samuel was closing in. He turned to the stranger, Mr. Oliver, "Your blackmail scheme didn't go as planned, did it, Mr. Oliver? Mr. Goodwin caught wind of your ploys and severed ties, threatening your entire operation."

Samuel finally turned to butler Mister Kent, who'd been standing rigidly against the mantle. "Mr. Kent," Samuel said, "You are above suspicion - the faithful butler. But the truth is more sinister. You had a secret alliance with Miss Howard. With Goodwin's death, she could reclaim her inheritance, and you could escape a life of servitude."

"But the murderer," Samuel said, “who cleverly employed a rare Himalayan poison, obtainable only by the one who recently visited the East - is none other than..."

He let out a deliberate pause, letting the tension mount, "You, Miss Howard."

Panic stricken, Miss Howard rose, “This is ludicrous! I...”

Detective Samuel cut her off. “You both planned the murder perfectly. But it was your letter, the one you believed had been burned,” he turned to Mister Kent, “that gave you away. The letter with traces of the same poison you thought no one could trace. The letter, where you asked her to meet you in the study, the night of the murder.”

As the truth sunk in, the room fell silent except for the relentless rain. As quiet shock was slowly replaced by disbelief and horror, Samuel concluded, "Justice, at times, may be blind – but it seldom remains mute."
