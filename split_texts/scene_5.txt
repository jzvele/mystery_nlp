Scene 5:
Scene: The Grand Salon of the majestic Glendale Manor. All the towering windows have been closed, a storm rages outside. The room is filled with an electric tension mirroring the storm outside. Detective Arthur Brunswick, known for his deductive brilliance, sits at the heads of the room. Standing near him are the suspects; the disinterested millionaire James Glendale, his spirited daughter Isabella, the shifty-eyed butler William, and the aloof family doctor, Dr. Harper.

Brunswick clears his throat, commanding attention. "Thank you for your patience. I have unraveled the tragic demise of Madam Glendale."

All eyes are on him, wide-eyed at the prospect of finally hearing the truth.

"Briefly reviewing the evidence, we found an unusually high dosage of strychnine in Madam Glendale's tea and puncture mark on her right arm from a needle. The cause of death was poisoning indeed." His gaze flicks to the doctor who nods in agreement, reassuring the room of the findings.

"The murder weapon then must be the needle that administered a fatal dosage of strychnine. Yet who had access to both the needle and the poison?"

Anxious eyes dart towards Dr. Harper, the quiet physician looking momentarily uneasy. He breaks the silence, "I work for the medical welfare of all in this house. I'd never harm Madam Glendale."

Brunswick nods, "You're indeed correct, Doctor. While it's true you have access to both, you lack the motive, unlike William here."

William's face blanches, his eyes wide with fear. "I... I did not kill her, sir!"

"Perhaps, but you had a good reason to. Your indebted gambling brother, Harry, wouldn't have a chance to repay his debts if James here ceased his assistance, a reality soon to come to pass given Madam Glendale’s insistence."

"I swear...I didn’t—" William starts, but Brunswick raises a hand to silence him.

"I believe you, William. It's not you. You lack the subtlety to execute such a discreet murder. The killer is someone who not only had access and motive but also the finesse to carry it out."

The room is silent, each individual holding their breath. Then, he turns to look at James Glendale. The millionaire widower stares back unmoving, icy blue eyes never faltering.

"You, Mr. Glendale, benefited most from your wife's demise. An unloving marriage, an ambitious nature hindered by your wife's principled stance against 'dirty money'... Her death conveniently removed the obstacles from your path."

"But I wouldn't murder for money," James defends, just a hint of wavering in his deep voice.

"No, not for money alone, maybe," Brunswick retorted, "but for freedom it offered you and for the one you constantly looked at with longing when you thought no one was watching. Am I right, Isabella?"

Isabella gasps, her usually fiery eyes wide and glistening. The room is still as the shocking truth lands.

"And so, Mr. Glendale, you discreetly took the strychnine and the needle from Dr. Harper's case during his house visits. Then, you poisoned your wife, manipulating everyone into suspecting the innocent butler or the doctor who was merely a tool in your deadly plot."

"The cruelty was not only in the execution but also in the orchestration, Mr. Glendale, using love and debts as convenient diversions." Detective Bruno sighs heavily, his eyes filled with disappointment. "This, ladies and gentlemen, is the truth behind Madame Glendale's untimely demise."
