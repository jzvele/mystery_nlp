Scene 11:
The grand library was a fitting setting for the climactic scene, a room filled with shadows and secrets, lined with thousands of dusty volumes containing tales of human nature at its highest and lowest. All the people bound directly and indirectly to the grisly murder of a wealthy heir gathered around the imposing mahogany table, with Detective Samuel Moore standing at its head, radiating a sober and somber authority.

Present were the bitter stepmother, Mrs. Rebecca Collins; the covetous brother, Mr. Andrew Collins; the sly family lawyer, Mr. Peter Hancock; the jealously-devoted housemaid, Ms. Martha Stuart; and the late victim’s bewildered fiancée, Ms. Laura Reynolds. Tension twisted the very air as Detective Moore began to speak.

"Thank you all for gathering here," he started, coolly scanning each face. "After untangling the web of deceit and resentment spun around the tragic demise of Mr. John Collins, I have come to a conclusion about the identity of his murderer.”

Everyone sat without a breath, all eyes trained on Detective Moore. It was as if life had turned into a sluggish, trickling stream.

"The key clue,” Moore continued, “Was the rather unusual episode of the missing cufflink. Whoever placed it among the late Mr. Collins’ linens intended to mislead the investigation to suggest self-hanging - an attempt that was, I might add, conspicuously amateurish.”

He paused and addressed the lawyer, “You see, Mr. Hancock, merely being privy to the inner workings of the Collins' estate does not necessarily equip you with necessary subtlety to orchestrate such a scheme. You were the only one with both access and knowledge of Mr. Collins’ family heirloom cufflinks. The singular cufflink we found proved to be part of a pair - the other discovered in your personal chambers.”

Hancock's face turned ashen. Astonishment etched the faces of the otherwise noble assembly.

"Indeed, you faked the suicide in the hope of preserving the inheritance for Andrew in exchange for a generous 'incentive'. You knew that Mrs. Collins' and Ms. Reynolds challenged the inheritance but never stood to gain directly from John's death,” Detective Moore concluded.

"But Detective, why would Mr. Hancock risk so much?” The housemaid asked, her voice shaking.

"Desperate debts and disrepute, Ms. Stuart." Detective Moore produced letters - a deluge of debts incurred by Hancock.

"And what could've enlisted Andrew's consent in this macabre scheme?” Ms. Reynolds demanded, her voice hoarse with unshed tears and rage.

"The allure of the wealth without sharing it - and the blind love to protect his brother from the bitter feuds with the rest," Moore glanced gravely at Andrew. Coerced by guilt, the brother broke down finally, his fall echoing the final solemn verdict. 

Thus, the crime was untangled, revealing the jarring ugliness under the façade of stature, wealth, and bonds.
