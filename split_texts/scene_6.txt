Scene 6:
The grand dining room at Thornfield Manor was filled to the brim, each suspect seated tensely around the imposing mahogany table. The ornate rococo chandeliers above cast ethereal shadows around the room, illuminating the visages of seven anxious characters cloaked in the night's resentment.

At the head of the table sat Inspector Hawke, his intelligent eyes darted back and forth, scrutinizing each player in this macabre game. His reputation as one of the best detectives in London preceded him, a fact that had all assembled on edge.

Lucille Thornfield, the icy, recently widowed heiress sat to the inspector’s right, her sharp gaze locked on him, her hands nervously trembling. Her brother, the disgruntled Jasper, nervously sipped the aged barmy wine, eyebrows knitted into a pained expression. Lady Arabella Maddox, their fiery aunt, bristled beside him, shooting furious glances at the family solicitor Mr. Wright, a reticent man with an eerie calm about him. Their longtime butler, Alfred, a relic of the Thornfield service, and the sly housemaid, Emma, rounded out the table.

“Ladies and Gentlemen,” began Inspector Hawke, “we are gathered here to shed the light on the unfortunate demise of Lord Thornfield.”

The room filled with hushed whispers. He waited until the voices subsided, then shifted his gaze towards Lucille. “Mrs. Thornfield, you stand to gain much from your husband's demise, given the fortunes left behind. Hence, suspicions naturally gravitated towards you."

Lucille tensed but remained silent.

"Yet," he continued, "there was no trace of poison found in Lord Thornfield's body, and I am quite certain that you, ma'am, lack the physical strength to cause such extensive internal injuries." 

He looked around the table and said, "But who says crime is only committed by hands?" Immediately his gaze landed on Alfred. "Lord Thornfield was a man of routine, a routine you, Alfred, were privy to, almost mechanically so. Before retiring, he partook in a nightly ritual of a cigar and brandy, supplied by you."

Shock registered on Alfred’s face. “I’ve served this family faithfully for twenty years, sir. I had no reason to harm the master.”

“Quite so,” agreed Hawke. “Alfred, you're a simple man caught in a ploy. You were merely an unfortunate pawn. The real culprit is someone who trusted you'd follow the routine. Who had the cunning mind to orchestrate such a conspiracy."

Squaring his gaze to the quiet Mr. Wright, he asserted, "Mr. Wright, the family's solicitor. Am I right?"

Mr. Wright, a splash of surprise flashed across his face quickly replaced with cool composure. “Proof, Inspector?”

“In the study room, I found a misplaced legal document, elaborating Jasper's inheritance only in the case of both his sister and his brother-in-law's deaths. Someone not very familiar with the decor of the house caused this misplacement, but knew enough to understand the inheritance intricacies. That's your role in the Manor, isn't it, Mr. Wright?”

Jasper spat. “This parasite approached me with the idea, swore only Lucille would be implicated. Bloody lies!”

In the tumult that erupted, Inspector Hawke’s stern voice declared, "The game is up, Wright."

The intricate lattice of relationships surrounding a fortune, the greed powerful enough to manipulate love and trust into a weapon of cunning destruction, was unveiled.
