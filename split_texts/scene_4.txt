Scene 4:
Scene setting: The grand drawing room of Stonebrook Manor, an imposing mansion found on the outskirts of London, is overflowing with a palpable tension. Detective Edgar Sterling, renowned for his keen observation skills and deductive prowess, stands by the roaring fireplace, his spine straight as a dart and gaze as sharp as the eagle.

Present amidst the crowd are the hot-tempered Colonel Hastings, lonely widower Mrs. Cadwell, the smooth-talking Senator Richardson, and the Manor's housekeeper, the seemingly taciturn Mrs. White. They all share a common thread despite their diverse backgrounds - each one a potential suspect in the gruesome murder of the estate's owner, wealthy industrialist Reginald Stonebrook.

"I trust I won't have to reside over this gloomy affair for much longer," Sterling began, focusing his gaze on the assembly. "The person responsible for the murder of Mr. Stonebrook is in this room."

Gasps echoed around the room, and anxious glances were exchanged. Mrs. Cadwell clutched her pearls tighter, Colonel Hastings's grip tightened around his walking stick, Senator Richardson's polished charm wavered, and Mrs. White polished her glasses with greater intensity.

Sterling paced the room, casting a piercing gaze at each suspect before halting. "The means behind the murder were simple, yet cunning. A poison, untraceable yet deadly, was slithered into the decanter of brandy which Mr. Stonebrook was so fond of." He paused for effect, looking pointedly at Mrs. Cadwell, who had been vehemently voicing her dislike for her late husband's drinking habits. Yet, in a sudden turn of events, she was absolved, as her shock seemed genuine.

"The fatal venom," he continued, "was discovered by yours truly in the greenhouse, known only to Mrs. White and one Colonel Hastings, the only persons fond enough of botany to even tread there."

A heavy silence befell the room as all eyes darted to the accused duo. Yet again, the detective surprised them, his gaze turned to the charismatic Senator. "However, the murderer, the person with a motive, was none other than Senator Richardson."

Outrage broke out, but Richardson nodded solemnly, accepting his fate. "But why?" came the desperate inquiry from Mrs. Cadwell.

"Because," Sterling revealed, "Richardson and Stonebrook were business partners once, before a financial fiasco, instigated by Stonebrook, ruined the Senator."

"And how would the Senator know of the poison?" questioned Colonel Hastings.

The detective concluded, "I found evidence connecting Senator Richardson to a secret correspondence with Mrs. White’s estranged botanist sister, providing him with the knowledge necessary to make the poison."

As the authorities arrived to apprehend Senator Richardson, the flurry of questions, surprise, and shock never ceased. Amid all the chaos, Detective Sterling stood tall – another mystery solved, another criminal caught.
