Scene 2:
Detective Rowan Lawson stood facing the gallery of anxious faces in the opulent drawing room of an aging British estate. The portraits of Harrington lineages bore witness to the culmination of this grave affair. He was surrounded by an unlikely assembly of wealthy matriarchs, disgruntled heirs, secretive housekeepers, and dubious business associates. His fingers tightly clasped his signature polished walking cane, the symbols etched deep with past encounters in solving the unsolvable. 

"The room is filled with a juxtaposition of emotions," he began, his resonant voice painting the canvas of the crime that has taken shape. "The murder of Mr. Fredrick Harrington was not an instance of errant chance, but the bitter fruit of calculated labor."

All eyes bore into Lawson. Mrs. Harrington, a figure of old aristocracy, held a trembling handkerchief to her finely-lined face. Her favored nephew, young Aiden, desperate to secure his piece of the fortune, was fidgeting nervously. Martha, the stern housekeeper who had dedicated her life to the Harrington household, stood by the framed doorway. Philip Rainsneck, an ambitious business associate burdened with the weight of crippling debts, was wringing his hands anxiously. 

"Everyone had a reason to want Mr. Harrington dead," Lawson continued. "Mrs. Harrington, to preserve the family honor defaced by scandalous rumors of her husband's extramarital affairs. Aiden, who has been left destitute by his gambling addiction. Martha, whose brother was wrongfully dismissed and disgraced by Mr. Harrington. And Mr. Rainsneck, whose debts could easily be cleared by any potential insurance payout post Mr. Harrington's death."

A murmur ran through the crowd. Fear, guilt, or surprise were painted on their faces. 

"But the crucial piece that leads us to the killer," Lawson's voice quickened, "was a single blue cornflower."

Mutual confusion spread through the room.

"A blue cornflower - the emblem of the secret lover with whom Mr. Harrington had been having an affair," Lawson proceeded. "And the only person who remarkably started wearing a blue cornflower the day after Mr. Harrington's murder was..."

All held their breath. Lawson's gaze fell on...

"Aiden Harrington."

Surprise rippled across the room. Aiden stood up, his face paling, "You’re accusing me?” he stammered, “But I didn’t even know about any affair. This is Preposterous!"

"But your relationship with the local florist, Miss Rebecca," Lawson continued unabated. "The same Miss Rebecca whom Mr. Harrington had been rumored to visit frequently. The cornflowers were a message, a tribute. You killed Mr. Harrington, not for his money, but out of revenge for his perceived corruption of Miss Rebecca- your secret love."

Silence fell over the room like a death shroud. 

It wasn't the wealth that led to the murder of Mr. Harrington, but a pitiful love triangle spun amidst the hard webs of deception. This was a classic mystery that Lawson, with his keen sense, had decoded, once again proving the omnipotence of a brilliant crime-solving mind.
