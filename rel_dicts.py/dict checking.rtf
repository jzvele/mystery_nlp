\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec4 Thank you. Are there other relationships in the novel that are not included in this dictionary? If so, can you please add them?\cb1 \

\fs32 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Thanks. Could you please modify this dictionary so that all of the relationships are expressed from the point of view of the character in the outer dictionary? So, for example, if Character A is Character B's mother, then Character A[Character B] should say "daughter", since that's who Character B is to Character A.
